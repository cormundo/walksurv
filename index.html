            <h2>Welcome to the Pune-MTL Walkability Survey!</h2>
            <p>Hello, thanks for agreeing to participate in this research exercise. We appreciate your time on this matter. Upon beginning the exercise, the researcher will verify that you performed the study, and will transfer funds to your account as previously discussed via email.</p>
            <p>The study consists of a brief demographic information section, and a series of images of streetscapes which you will answer questions about. These questions will seek to evaluate how you are perceiving the urban environment. You have 1 hour to tag as many images as you feel comfortable processing. Please note that you can stop the exercise at any time, and that the study is completely confidential. To review the consent form you previously signed, please click here. "</p>
